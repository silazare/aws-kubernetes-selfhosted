# Define an IP pool named "general-pool" for Cilium to use for LoadBalancer IPs.
# This pool includes the IP range from multipass network CIDR (192.168.64.0/24)
# !!! Use it wisely with no overlapping, because it will be used for all LoadBalancer services !!!
#
# Traffic flow: External > <LoadBalancer IP from IP pool> > Any Node > Cilium > Pod
#
# Multipass network: 192.168.64.0/24
# Master node: 192.168.64.6
# Worker node: 192.168.64.7
# Available range for LoadBalancer IPs: 192.168.64.10-192.168.64.254
